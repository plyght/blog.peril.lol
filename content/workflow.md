## Hardware Setup

I use a **MacBook Pro (M3, 14-inch, 2024)** with **16GB of RAM** and **1TB SSD**. Itâ€™s powerful enough for development, design, and handling multiple apps simultaneously without any lag.

### Dark Mode and Appearance

I keep my Mac in **Dark Mode** for better eye comfort:
```bash
# Switch to Dark Mode
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to tell appearance preferences to set dark mode to true'
